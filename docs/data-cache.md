# Data Cache

CrossInk caches data aggressively on the SD card to minimize RAM use. The ESP32-C3 has about 380 KB of usable RAM, so rebuilding every book structure in memory on every open would be too expensive.

The main data directory is `.crosspoint` on the SD card. It stores render caches and persistent user/device data.

## Directory Layout

└── txt_12471232/           # TXT progress, page index, and generated cover image
```

Four-tone sleep covers use separate `_absolute.bmp` files so older cover shading is not reused. These are generated on demand for supported displays; TXT/Markdown JPG covers also use a separate `cover_absolute.bmp`. Existing cover and thumbnail caches remain available, and no manual cache reset is needed.

## Clearing Cache Data

Deleting the entire `.crosspoint` directory resets caches, settings, saved network/server data, bookmarks, recent books, reading progress, and reading stats.

To clear EPUB/XTC render caches from the device UI without deleting settings or global stats, use:

**Settings > System > Files & Cache > Clear Reading Cache**

## Book Moves And Cache Identity

Cache folders are path-based. Moving a book file can create a new cache directory, so the moved copy may start with fresh reading progress unless the firmware migrates the cache for that move. CrossInk migrates cache and bookmark data for the built-in move-to-Read flow and related file-browser move actions.

EPUB reader font, page layout, styling, and reading-aid settings normally come from the global Reader settings. Changes made inside an EPUB override only the fields whose values differ from the global defaults; the other fields continue to inherit later global changes. EPUB render mode is stored separately per book so a problematic title can be switched to Balanced or Light rendering from the File Browser or Recent Books long-press menus before opening it. Older full-snapshot book overrides retain their original behavior until reset or edited again.

EPUB clippings and highlights live outside the EPUB render-cache folder in
`/.crosspoint/clippings/`. Each book gets a binary clipping file named from the
book type and the CRC32 of the book path. The same clipping record powers the
in-reader highlight, the clipping list, and jump-back behavior. CrossInk also
appends a Kindle-style text export to `/My Clippings.txt` on the SD-card root;
that export is human-readable and append-only, so deleting a clipping in the UI
removes the in-app saved clipping but does not rewrite old text already exported
to `/My Clippings.txt`.

Cache data is cleared by supported CrossInk delete/move flows. If you remove or rename books outside CrossInk by editing the SD card directly, old cache folders may remain until you clear reading cache.

All-time reading stats can also be backed up outside `.crosspoint` in:

```text
/.crossink-stats-backup/
```

For binary file layout details, see [File Formats](./file-formats.md).

## Library

Library replaces the Recent Books screen. It reconciles the SD card on entry and
through the refresh icon in the Library header, reusing metadata for unchanged books.
**Settings > Display > Use Book Metadata** selects embedded EPUB titles and
authors; disabling it uses filenames. TXT, Markdown and XTC files use filename
fallbacks. CLX1 version 2 adds a first-name author permutation; older Library
indexes rebuild automatically when Library opens.

**Date Added** uses the file creation time captured by the index. Its
first-seen sequence breaks ties and orders books without a creation time among
themselves; those books appear before dated books in ascending order.
The creation time is the filesystem's best available estimate of when a file
arrived on the card; some copy tools may preserve the original timestamp.
**Recently Opened** shows only books in the
saved reading history (up to 18 books), newest first. Reversing that sort shows
the same books oldest first. Marking a book unfinished does not add it to
reading history; opening it does.
Search matches words in the title and author and retains the selected sort.
The sort method and direction are saved when changed. The Library Settings icon
opens a compact/expanded list toggle and independent visibility switches for
EPUB, XTC/XTCH, TXT, and Markdown files. Expanded Title and Author sorts show
alphabetic headings; hidden file types remain indexed and can be shown again
without a rescan. Markdown books open as plain text in the TXT reader.
Expanded is the default for new Library preferences; a saved Compact choice remains respected.
Author (Last Name) sorts by the final word of the displayed author, while
Author (First Name) sorts by the displayed name from its beginning.
Series metadata and series sorting are not part of this UI change.

On button devices, Up from the first book reaches sort direction, sort method,
settings, search, and refresh. Confirm activates the selected control; holding Confirm on
a book opens its actions. On touch devices, tap the header icons or sort controls
directly and hold a book row for its actions. The sort method opens a modal list.

The Lyra Carousel snapshot cache advances to version 7 so cached home menus
regenerate with the Library label and landmark icon. No manual EPUB cache reset is required.
