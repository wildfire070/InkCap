# Controls

The Controls menu lets you customize front buttons, side buttons, and reader shortcuts.

## Settings Menu Layout

### Power Button

- Short-press action
- Long-press action
- Power + Up action

### Front Buttons

- Remap front buttons
- Remap front buttons while reading
- Orientation aware
- Long-press behavior (in-reader only)
- Long-press back action (in-reader only)
- Long-press menu action (in-reader only)

Note: Even though some actions assigned to the front buttons could be used globally, they are restricted to apply within the reader only due to the dynamic nature of the front buttons (they can mean different things based on the screen you're on).

### Side Buttons

- Side-button chord (where supported)
- Left/Up short-press and long-press actions
- Right/Down short-press and long-press actions

### Taps & Gestures

- Next Page
- Previous Page
- Pinch to Resize Font (on supported multi-touch devices)
- Two-finger Screen Rotation (on supported multi-touch devices)
- Tap to Hide Status Bar
- Two-finger Swipe (on supported multi-touch devices)
- Edge Gestures

### Next Page and Previous Page Gestures

On touchscreen devices, **Next Page** and **Previous Page** are in
**Settings > Controls > Taps & Gestures**. They change page-turn gestures while
reading and can be configured independently. In left-to-right books, **Next
Page** controls taps and left swipes; **Previous Page** controls taps and right
swipes. Right-to-left EPUBs reverse the normal tap zones and horizontal swipe
directions to follow reading order.

Both settings offer the same options:

| Option | Taps | Swipes |
| ------ | ---- | ------ |
| **Tap & Swipe** (default) | Enabled | Enabled |
| **Tap Only** | Enabled | Disabled |
| **Swipe Only** | Disabled | Enabled |
| **Inverted Tap** | Enabled, with reversed tap zones | Disabled |
| **Disabled** | Disabled | Disabled |

When both directions allow taps, the normal zones are the left third for the
previous page and the right two-thirds for the next page. If either of those
settings is **Inverted Tap**, the shared zones become the left two-thirds for
the next page and the right third for the previous page. If only one direction
allows taps, taps across the page turn in that direction. The top and bottom
gesture bands are reserved for vertical gestures, so taps there do not turn
pages. A **Previous Page** setting that does not allow swipes also prevents a
rightward edge swipe from being treated as Back/Home while reading.

## Pinch to Resize Font

On touchscreen devices with multi-touch support, enable **Pinch to Resize Font**
in **Settings > Controls > Taps & Gestures**. While reading an EPUB or TXT
book, move two fingers apart to increase the font or together to decrease it.
Each completed pinch changes one available font-size step. Pinch resizing also
requires reader touch input to be enabled. XTC pages are pre-rendered,
so this option cannot resize them.

## Two-finger Screen Rotation

On touchscreen devices with multi-touch support, **Two-finger Screen Rotation**
is enabled by default in **Settings > Controls > Taps & Gestures**. While
reading an EPUB or TXT book, place two fingers on the page and twist them to
rotate the reading orientation one step, the same as changing **Reading
Orientation** by hand. The new orientation is saved, so it survives sleep and
restart. Turn the toggle off if accidental twists rotate the page while you
read; the four-way **Reading Orientation** setting still works.

## Tap to Hide Status Bar

**Tap to Hide Status Bar** is enabled by default. When it is enabled, tap the
visible status-bar area while reading to show or hide the entire bar for the
current reading session. The toggle does not change page layout or page breaks;
tap the same status-bar region again to restore a hidden bar. Use **Status
Bars** to choose which items the top and bottom bars contain. The tap is available while reader touch input
is enabled. For XTC books, when an XTC status bar is
enabled, tap its configured top or bottom edge both to hide and to restore it.

## Two-finger Swipe Actions

On touchscreen devices with multi-touch support, open **Settings > Controls >
Taps & Gestures > Two-finger Swipe** to assign actions to the four swipe
directions. During reading, place two fingers on the page and move them
together in the configured direction. Use **Not Set** to leave a direction
unassigned.

Each action can be assigned to only one direction. If you assign an action to a
new direction, CrossInk clears its previous direction automatically.

Available actions depend on the device and reader:

| Action | Availability |
| --- | --- |
| Increase Brightness / Decrease Brightness | Devices with a frontlight |
| Increase Warmth / Decrease Warmth | Devices with an adjustable warm/cool frontlight |
| Select Chapter | EPUB and XTC books with a chapter list |
| Next Chapter / Previous Chapter | EPUB readers |
| Increase Font Size / Decrease Font Size | EPUB and TXT readers |

Brightness and warmth respond while you drag, with longer swipes allowing
finer one-point adjustments. Use a clear, mostly straight motion so both
contacts are recognized as one gesture. Configured two-finger swipes are
handled separately from the ordinary one-finger page-turn mapping. Select Chapter opens the chapter list in EPUB and XTC books. On image-based XTC books, Next/Previous Chapter and font-size
actions are consumed but cannot change the pre-rendered pages.

## Edge Gestures

On touchscreen devices, open **Settings > Controls > Taps & Gestures > Edge
Gestures**. Assign actions separately to **Left Edge Up**, **Left Edge Down**,
**Right Edge Up**, and **Right Edge Down**. Start with one finger close to the
chosen screen edge and slide vertically while staying along that edge. All four
start as **Not Set**.

The available actions match [Two-finger Swipe Actions](#two-finger-swipe-actions):
brightness and warmth on supported hardware, Select Chapter in EPUB/XTC books, chapter changes in EPUBs, and
font-size changes in EPUB/TXT books. Edge slides do not require multi-touch.
Brightness and warmth respond while you drag; a longer slide gives finer
one-point adjustments. Chapter and font-size actions run when you lift your
finger. XTC pages cannot be resized or use the EPUB chapter actions.

## Side Button Actions

Open **Settings > Controls > Side Buttons** to assign a **Short-press Action**
and **Long-press Action** independently to **Left/Up** and **Right/Down**.
These actions apply while reading. A short action runs on release; a configured
long action runs after a hold of about **0.7 seconds**, without also running
the short action. Existing side-button layouts are converted to matching
individual actions when you update.

Alongside the usual reader shortcuts, you can choose:

- **Previous Page** or **Next Page** to swap page-turn directions or make both
  buttons advance.
- **Previous Chapter** or **Next Chapter** for EPUB chapter navigation.
- **Increase Font Size** or **Decrease Font Size** for EPUB/TXT text.
- **Rotate Page CCW**, **Rotate Page CW**, or **Rotate Page 180°** for EPUB/TXT
  orientation changes. The labels describe the direction the page turns.
- **Ignore** to leave a press unassigned.

XTC books have pre-rendered pages, so font-size and page-rotation actions do not
apply. **Orientation aware** remains a separate option for side-button mapping.

## Power, Back, and Menu Button Actions

Defaults:

- Short-press Power Button Action: Ignore
- Long-press Power Button Action: Sleep/Wake
- Long-press Back Button Action: Browse Files
- Long Press Menu Button Action: Ignore

Available actions include:

- Ignore
- Sleep (also available to chord and Home-button shortcuts)
- Sleep/Wake or Wake (Power button only)
- Next Page
- Refresh Screen
- Change Font
- Guide Dots
- Focus Reading
- Toggle Bookmark
- Sync Book
- Mark as Finished
- Reading Stats
- Take Screenshot
- Auto Page Turn Interval
- File Transfer
- Calibre Wireless
- Join a Network
- Create Hotspot
- Tilt Page Turn (X3 only)
- Footnotes
- Dark Mode
- Browse Files
- Library
- Create Clipping
- Look Up Word
- Quick Lock
- Quick Actions
- Toggle Frontlight (on supported devices)
- Toggle Touchscreen (on supported devices)

Power short- and long-press actions are separate. A short press wakes the
device only when its **Short-press Action** is **Sleep/Wake** or **Wake**.
**Sleep** only puts an awake device to sleep; **Wake** does nothing while it is
awake. Holding Power always wakes the sleeping device. For the full startup
instructions, see [Power On / Off](./user-guide.md#power-on--off).

Assign **Library** to a Power, Back/Menu long-press, chord, Home-button, or
Quick Actions shortcut to open the book list directly, where that shortcut is
supported.

## Power + Up Shortcut

The **Power + Up** shortcut runs the action selected in **Settings > Controls >
Power Button > Power + Up**. It is disabled by default. Press the **Power** and **Volume Up**
buttons together to trigger it, then release both buttons before using another
shortcut.

The shortcut can run many of the same actions available for the Power button,
including **Quick Lock**. The existing **Power + Volume Down** screenshot
shortcut is unchanged.

## Quick Actions Triggers

In **Settings > Quick Actions**, assign the menu to one shortcut. Available
triggers include short- or long-press Power, **Power + Up**, and on X4 Pro,
**Tap Home**, **Long-Press Home**, or **Double Tap Home**. Selecting a trigger
there replaces any previous Quick Actions trigger; it does not change the five
actions in the menu.

## Quick Lock

**Quick Lock** temporarily disables normal button and touchscreen input while
leaving the current screen visible. A lock badge appears on the display while
the device is locked. It is useful when carrying the reader or setting it down
while reading.

Quick Lock can be assigned to **Power + Up**, short- or long-press **Power**,
or long-press **Back** or **Menu**. Trigger the assigned action to toggle the
lock. While locked, repeat that same shortcut to unlock; all other buttons,
including **Power + Volume Down** screenshots, and touchscreen input stay
locked.

Quick Lock still follows the regular **Time to Sleep** setting. If the timeout
expires, the device sleeps and restores the lock when it wakes. Reading timers
pause while Quick Lock is active.

## Footnote Shortcut

When a shortcut is mapped to **Footnotes**, it opens the page-reference selector
(or a list fallback) while reading. If the current page has only one footnote,
CrossInk opens that referenced page directly.

The **Quick-return from Footnotes** setting controls whether the Power button
acts like Back after opening a footnote page. It appears under **Settings >
Controls > Power Button** only after assigning **Footnotes** to Power short/long
press or Back/Menu long press. See [Footnote Navigation](./user-guide.md#footnote-navigation)
for selecting references on the page.
