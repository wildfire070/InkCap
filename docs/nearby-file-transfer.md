# Nearby File Transfer

Nearby File Transfer sends one supported file directly between two nearby
CrossInk readers. It uses ESP-NOW, so it does not need a Wi-Fi network,
internet connection, account, or computer.

## Requirements

- Both readers must run compatible CrossInk builds and be nearby.
- The receiving reader needs enough free SD-card space for the complete file.
- Supported file types are EPUB, TXT, XTC, XTCH, PNG, and BMP.

## Receive a File

1. On the receiving reader, open **File Transfer > Receive File**.
2. Select **Start receiving**. The screen stays open while it waits for a
   sender.
3. To change where received files are saved, select **Change folder** before
   starting. CrossInk remembers this folder; the default is the SD-card root.
4. When the incoming-file prompt appears, check the sender name, file name,
   and size, then select **Accept**. Use **Cancel** or **Back** to decline it.
5. Wait for the receiving progress screen to finish. After verification, select
   **Read** for a book or **Open** for an image, or use **Back** to return.

If a file with the same name already exists in the destination folder,
CrossInk asks whether to **Replace** it, **Keep both**, or cancel. **Keep both**
creates a separate copy with a numbered suffix.

## Send a File

1. On the receiving reader, start **Receive File** as described above.
2. On the sending reader, find a supported file in **Browse Files** or
   **Library**.
3. Open the file action menu and select **Send to Nearby Device**.
4. Wait for the receiving reader to appear, select it, and wait for approval.
5. Keep both readers on their transfer screens until the sender reports
   **File sent** and the receiver reports **File received**.

The receiver must accept the offer before the file starts sending. Press
**Back** on either reader to cancel an in-progress transfer.

## Transfer Safety

CrossInk writes incoming data to a temporary file and verifies its size and
contents before making it available at the chosen destination. A cancelled or
failed transfer does not replace an existing file and does not leave a usable
partial book or image behind.

## Troubleshooting

**No receiving device appears**

Make sure the receiver has selected **Start receiving**, both readers are close
together, and both run compatible CrossInk builds. Exit and reopen the transfer
screens on both readers, then try again.

**Unsupported file type**

Nearby File Transfer only supports EPUB, TXT, XTC, XTCH, PNG, and BMP files.
Use the web file manager, Calibre Wireless, or USB for other file types.

**Not enough space on the SD card**

Free space in the receiving folder's SD card, then start the transfer again.

**The other device stopped responding** or **Transfer failed**

Keep both readers nearby and on their transfer screens until completion, then
retry the whole transfer. The sender keeps the original file, and the receiver
only keeps the new file after verification succeeds.
