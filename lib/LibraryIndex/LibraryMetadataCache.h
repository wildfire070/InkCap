// Persistent EPUB metadata, written as each book is parsed.
//
// The Library index already reuses metadata from the previous index, but only
// once a whole build has finished and installed. A huge card can take far
// longer than anyone waits, and a cancelled or failed build used to throw every
// parse away. This cache keeps each parse the moment it happens, so the next
// build resumes where the last one stopped without remembering where that was:
// a book is found again by its identity, never by a directory cursor, so files
// added, moved, or removed in between do not matter.
//
// Two files under /.crosspoint:
//
//   library.meta  header, then a fixed open-addressing table of 16-byte slots
//                 {pathHash, payloadOffset, check}. 65,536 slots is twice the
//                 format ceiling, so probes stay short; the table is 1 MiB.
//   library.metd  append-only payload records {pathHash, size, mtime, series
//                 position, string lengths, checksum, strings}.
//
// The identity is the complete-path hash plus the file size and modification
// time; any change to the book is a miss. Every slot and payload carries a
// checksum, and anything that does not verify is treated as absent, so a torn
// write after a power cut costs a re-parse, never wrong metadata.
//
// Nothing here scales with the library in RAM: one open handle per file and a
// few counters. Lookups are a couple of short seeks against a parse that takes
// hundreds of milliseconds.
