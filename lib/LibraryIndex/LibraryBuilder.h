#pragma once

// Builds the CLX1 index by walking the SD card once.
//
// The walk derives filename fallbacks and can read title, author, series/order, and subject metadata from
// EPUBs. Fresh metadata is reused from the previous index.
//
// Shape of the build, and why:
//
//   * ONE walk. Records go straight into a staging file in discovery order, so
//     nothing proportional to the library stays resident. The previous index is
//     matched through a sorted file with a small in-RAM fence, and every order
//     is sorted in bounded runs (LibrarySort.h) whose buffer is the only sizable
//     allocation after the walk: 32 KiB on the C3, the whole sort in PSRAM.
//   * Duplicate directory entries are dropped. A damaged FAT can hand the same
//     file out twice, and without this the shelf shows phantom books that
//     cannot be opened.
//   * Unreadable entries are skipped, never fatal.
//   * Install is write-then-rename, so an interrupted build leaves the previous
//     index untouched rather than a half-written one.
