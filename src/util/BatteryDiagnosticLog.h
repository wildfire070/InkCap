// Battery telemetry log, for diagnosing a fuel gauge that misreports state of
// charge. The X3's BQ27220 is read raw - no calibration, no cross-check - so a
// device can sit at a confident 87% and then die.
//
// Serial logging cannot capture this. Any USB connection powers the device, and
// on the X3 (which has no charger IC) it also flips the sign of the gauge's
// current register, which is exactly what isCharging() infers charge state
// from. Observing a real discharge means writing to the SD card instead.
//
// Rows are appended to /battery_log.csv as:
//   timestamp,uptime_ms,soc,mv,charging,event
// A field that could not be read is written empty rather than as a plausible
// zero. The timestamp is local wall-clock at minute resolution - HalClock does
// not expose the RTC's seconds - so use uptime_ms to order rows within one
// wake.
//
// Enable with -DCROSSINK_BATTERY_DIAG_LOG=1. The `debug` env already sets it;
// no shipping environment does. Firmware only - the simulator's stand-in HAL
// has no battery backend to sample, so the flag must stay off there.
